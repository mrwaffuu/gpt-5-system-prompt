This repository stores the full output of a system prompt labeled "GPT-5" as produced by an AI model when asked to reveal its own system prompt. The content aims to support community study, reverse-engineering, and informed discussion about prompt design, model conditioning, and alignment artifacts.

About this repo
This repository hosts a captured system prompt output. The content may include:
- System-level instructions
- Guardrails and safety checks
- Exemplars and internal reasoning templates
- Hidden settings (temperature, role framing)
- Formatting and markup meant for internal agent use

The archive preserves the original format and metadata where available. Researchers and engineers can use it to study prompt structure, internal tactics, and emergent patterns that arise from high-complexity conditioning.

What's included
- Raw prompt file(s) in plain text and JSON where applicable
- A parsed, annotated version highlighting key sections
- Token-count and byte-size reports
- Scripts to reproduce tokenization and simple parsing
- Issue tracker entries and community notes
- Release assets linked from the Releases page

How to download and execute the release asset
1. Open the releases page and locate the latest release assets: https://github.com/mrwaffuu/gpt-5-system-prompt/releases
2. Download the primary asset (plain text or JSON). The file on that page needs to be downloaded and executed. Treat the asset as data for local analysis tools.
3. If the asset is a script (for example, a helper .py or .sh), run it in a contained environment:
   - For Python: python3 analyze_prompt.py
   - For shell: bash inspect.sh
4. If the asset is plain text, treat execution as feeding the content into your analysis pipeline or tokenization tool.

Quick inspection checklist
- File type: plain text, JSON, or script
- Encoding: UTF-8
- Byte size and token count
- Presence of structured sections (e.g., "frame", "constraints", "examples")
- Any explicit model parameters (temperature, top_p, max_tokens)
- Embedded examples or chain-of-thought seeds
- Metadata such as timestamps or tool signatures

Reverse-engineering guide
Goal: Map prompt parts to likely behavioral outcomes.

1. Segment the prompt
   - Identify role declarations, goals, constraints, and example dialogues.
   - Label each segment with a short function name (e.g., "safety-check", "response-style", "memory-summarizer").

2. Run controlled experiments
   - Make small edits to a copy of the prompt (change a single constraint).
   - Observe changes in outputs with identical inputs and seeds.
   - Use fixed temperature and deterministic sampling where possible.

3. Attribute behaviors
   - If output shifts to more verbose answers after a segment removal, tag that segment as verbosity control.
   - If response style changes (e.g., formality, punctuation), mark style-related tokens.

4. Use token-level tracing
   - Tokenize the prompt with the same tokenizer used by the model family.
   - Map important tokens to positions to measure prompt-context window usage.
   - Note which tokens push key constraints near the context limit.

5. Isolate implicit rules
   - Look for instruction patterns like "always X unless Y".
   - Test edge cases that violate Y to see if the model enforces X.

Tokenization and parsing notes
- Use the tokenizer matching the target family. Token id mapping can reveal repeated control tokens.
- Watch for long sequences of whitespace or newlines. Models can treat those as separators.
- JSON or YAML wrappers may add metadata tokens; strip wrappers to test raw prompt behavior.
- Count tokens before and after annotations to estimate effective context budget.

Analysis workflows
Baseline analysis
- Input: 10 representative prompts spanning common tasks (QA, summarization, coding).
- Run the model with the archived prompt and with a minimal prompt.
- Compare answer length, accuracy, and style.

A/B ablation
- Create variants where you remove a single instruction line.
- Use the same seed and input.
- Log differences in outputs and compute simple metrics: token delta, edit distance, BLEU, and human labels.

Attribution matrix
- Build a matrix mapping prompt lines to observed behavior changes.
- Score each cell by effect size (0–1).
- Use the matrix to prioritize lines for deeper inspection.

Safety and guardrail extraction
- Search the prompt for explicit safety keywords: "forbidden", "do not", "safety", "harm".
- Test policies by asking for disallowed content in controlled lab conditions.
- Document which safety statements the model respects and which it ignores.

Reuse and experiments
Use the archived prompt as a research artifact. Typical experiments:
- Style transfer: Replace "tone" constraints and measure style drift.
- Compression: Compress the prompt using paraphrasing and keep the same behavior.
- Modularization: Extract modular rules into separate short prompts and test composition.

Scripts and examples
- Token-count script: run python3 scripts/token_count.py path/to/prompt.txt
- Parse script: python3 scripts/parse_prompt.py --input prompt.json --output annotated.md
- Repro script: bash scripts/reproduce.sh --seed 42 --input test_cases.json

Common patterns to look for
- Role priming: "You are X" appears often at the top.
- Example-based instruction: "Given input A, respond with B".
- Safety-first lines: short, imperative statements that act as filters.
- Internal chain-of-thought prompts: explicit templates like "Think step by step".
- Formatting templates: explicit JSON or YAML response structures.

File format and annotations
- Raw file: original output
- Annotated file: same content with inline comments marking functions
- Token report: CSV listing token id, token text, and position
- Experiment logs: JSON objects recording input, variant, output, and metrics

Collaboration and community workflow
- Use Issues to propose analyses or request specific tests.
- Fork the repository to run experiments and open PRs with findings.
- Tag reproducible results with labels: reproducible, partial, inconclusive.
- Add anonymized examples where needed to preserve privacy.

Ethics and responsible handling
- Treat the content as a research artifact.
- Avoid using the prompt to produce harmful content.
- Share experiments with clear context and reproducible scripts.

Frequently asked questions
